# Musvis

I wanted to work on something fun, and here it is! It's a music visualizer. It is currently a work in progress (as is this README) but it works... kind of. It'll get better as time goes.

All you should need to do to get set up is to install SFML via apt and you should be good to go. Keep in mind this command is for a linux-style environment. Other installation instructions can be found on the SFML website.

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`

After installing, run `make` and build the executable. It's ran as `./musviz <some_audio_file>.wav`. 

Thanks for taking a look!
