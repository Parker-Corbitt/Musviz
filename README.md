# Musviz

I wanted to work on something fun, and here it is! It's a music visualizer. It is currently a work in progress (as is this README) but it works... kind of. It'll get better as time goes.

I have included a build script `build.sh` that will install the necessary dependencies for a linux style environment using apt as the package manager. Feel free to adapt it to your needs! 

Thanks for taking a look!
